Grid Search and Randomized Search CV Implementation in Machine Learning. 

Here we are going to look at Gird Search CV and Randomized Search CV and find the best parameters for our model.

Here we got 95% accuracy for our model which is really good.

The model we are going to use here is called svm (Support Vector Machine)

After finding our parameters we will give our own input vale and we will let our model make predictions.
